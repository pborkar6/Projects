Module 2 Program README

- Set up: extract one or all of the provided datasets to a known directory
  - The directory should contain all PNG images of the dataset with the original file names

- Start the program in MATLAB by executing module2_gui.m

- Select the directory of the desired dataset at the top left
  - This will load all PNG images from the directory

- Select the feature matrix corresponding to the dataset at the top right
  - Dataset1 should have './featurematrices/dataset1_feature_matrix.mat'
  - Dataset2 should have
    - './featurematrices/dataset2_feature_matrix.mat' for full grade classification
    - './featurematrices/dataset2_feature_matrix_binary.mat' for high/low classification
  - Dataset3 should have
    - './featurematrices/dataset3_feature_matrix.mat' for full grade classification
    - './featurematrices/dataset3_feature_matrix_binary.mat' for high/low classification

- Select a specific image in the top left panel using the arrows or dropdown box
  - When the dataset is split into folds, this image will always be in the test fold

- View the effect of various parameters on the segmentation in the top right panel
  - Note: this will not affect the classification since the features have been precomputed in the provided feature matrices
  - Note: this will affect the feature matrix generated by the "Generate..." button at the top right

- View the features extracted from all images in the dataset in the bottom left panel
  - In the histograms, the red line shows the feature value of the selected image with respect to the dataset
  - In the feature rank graph, the red line shows the current selected feature

- Finally, train the classifiers and view the classification result in the bottom right panel
  - The classification result shows the predicted and actual labels for the selected image and whether they match
  - The heatmap shows the (average - stdev) performance over all folds of the various classifier parameters
  - The internal vs external CV graph shows how well the classifier performs and generalizes overall
